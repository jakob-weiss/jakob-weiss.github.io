I joined the [Getz Lab](https://getzlab.org/) at the [Broad Institute](https://broadinstitute.org) in May 2023 as a Computational Associate. Currently, I work on elucidating mechanisms of drug resistance in HER2+ breast cancer and glioblastoma.

Previously, I worked under [Dr. Nikhil Wagle](https://waglelab.dana-farber.org/) at the Broad and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. There, I focused on harmonization of bulk RNA sequencing data across several breast cancer cohorts, as well as elucidation of genomic and transcriptomic correlates of intrinsic subtype switching in breast cancer. I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from [Boston College](https://bc.edu) in 2022 with a B.S. in biology and a minor in computer science.
